Installing Solaris::Disk::VTOC
====================================


Solaris::Disk::VTOC aims to provide methods to read Solaris disks
partitions (aka slices).

To install the module, simply run the following commands
(where x.xx is the current script version):

    $ tar xvzf Solaris-Disk-VTOC-x.xx.tar.gz
    $ cd Solaris-Disk-VTOC-x.xx
    $ perl Makefile.PL

and as root:

    # make install

If you are used to the CPAN way of doing things, the procedure is the
same as always:

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make test
    # make install

To run the tests, you just need Solaris::Disk::VTOC.
